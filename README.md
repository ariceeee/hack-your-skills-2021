# COSC 111 Review: The Game
This project was created as part of 'Hack Your Skills', a two-month long program in which teams of first year students collaborate on a coding project of their choice, hosted by UBC Okanagan's Girls in Tech club.

## Description
We created this game to make reviewing for COSC 111 (an introductory computer science course at UBC Okanagan) fun and engaging. Feel free to explore the map, but beware of entering the bushes as you may initiate a battle! The battle mechanics resemble those of Pokemon battles but instead of battling Pokemon, you're going to be battling enemies which a CS student might have, like a NullPointerException or a bad internet connection! And instead of using your Pokemon's moves to defeat them, you'll be answering multiple choice questions that pertain to COSC 111 concepts.

## How to Play
To move the player around the map: Arrow Keys

To answer multiple choice questions: 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D' keys
